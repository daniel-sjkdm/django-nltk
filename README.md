# Django nltk

This project uses django as backend along with other python's libraries like
praw to fetch posts from Reddit api and nltk to analyse the content at 
a parsing level:

+ word tokens
+ word stems
+ word lemma
+ part of speech tagging 

There's also a section where you can choose a bot to chat with. The bots are the existing ones
in nltk, so it's not an advanced feature but a basic one to practice the basics of NLP and 
integrating it with web development.
